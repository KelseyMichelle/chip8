# chip8 emulator

uses command line interfacing to load emulators

example:
```cargo run pong.ch8```

controls for pong are A and Z for left size, and M and K for right side.
controls are difficult because each game/rom interprets them differently.

put roms into a directory named _roms_ in the _src_ directory.
